# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th.

I decided to use TypeScript for this challenge. Normally, I use C# for the AOC, but I haven't been using C# as much lately.

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own directory:

```
/src/dayOne
/src/dayTwo
/src/etc...
```

## Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 01  | ⭐     | ⭐     |
| 02  | ⭐     | ⭐     |
| ... | ...    | ...    |

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm run dev
```

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve two programming puzzles each day from December 1st through December 25th. The puzzles can be solved in any programming language and provide an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills and learn new programming concepts.
